Deployment:

1. pre-checks:-
kubectl get nodes          // to check all nodes are up and running
kubectl get pods           // to chech the existing pods
kubectl get deployments   // to chech the existing deployments

2. In deployment manifest update the new image name.
After changes execute the below command:-
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml         // to apply the changes (or) to apply the file
kubectl edit -f deployment.yaml          // it will update config temporarily but once we redeploy the pod this config will be erase

3. Kubernetes will create new pods with the new image, and then gradually replace the old pods with the new one and its run with new image.

4.Additional commands to replicate the application:

kubectl scale deployment deployment-name --replicas=2
kubectl get deployments
kubectl scale deployment deployment-name --replicas=1
kubectl get deployments
